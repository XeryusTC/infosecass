The slides have the computing speed of 2012, because we are nearly in 2015 we can say that 3 years have past, or in other words, according to Moore's Law we have had two doublings of computing power. So a server year is now $2^2 \cdot 2^{61} = 2^{63}$ cycles. Finding a collision for a 64 bit key would thus take a year on a single server. We want to do this in $2^{-4}$ years however so a single server will be able to do $2^{59}$ cycles. We thus need $2^4$ servers to find a collision. Renting a single server costs \euro $2^8$, so the total cost for cracking this key would be $2^8 \cdot 2^4 =\mbox{\euro} 2^{12}$ or approximately \euro 4000,-
