Trudy could easily gain access to the box by intercepting the package after Alice sends it, adding her own padlock an sending it back to Alice. Alice will receive the package and assume that the extra padlock was added by Bob. She will then remove her own padlock and send the package on its way again. At this point Trudy can intercept it again and remove her own padlock, which is the only one on the box, thus she has just gained access.

After this she can put her padlock on the box again, send it to Bob and as he thinks that the box came Alice he will add his own padlock and send it back to Alice. Trudy can intercept it, remove her padlock and send the box back to Bob, who will be able to open the box. Both Alice and Bob will be none the wiser that Trudy has gained access to the box during the entire exchange.
