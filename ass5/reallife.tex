Trudy could easily gain access to the box by intercepting the package after Alice sends it, adding her own padlock an sending it back to Alice. Alice will receive the package and assume that the extra padlock was added by Bob. She will then remove her own padlock and send the package on its way again. At this point Trudy can intercept it again and remove her own padlock, which is the only one on the box, thus she has just gained access.

After this she can put her padlock on the box again, send it to Bob and as he thinks that the box came Alice he will add his own padlock and send it back to Alice. Trudy can intercept it, remove her padlock and send the box back to Bob, who will be able to open the box. Both Alice and Bob will be none the wiser that Trudy has gained access to the box during the entire exchange.

To ensure that Trudy will not be able to gain access to the box Alice and Bob have to come up with a way to authenticate the padlocks as being theirs. This can be done by adding a tag to the padlock which can only be added when the padlock gets locked and can not be added or removed while it is locked (in other words, it is also tamper proof like the padlocks themselves). An example could be that they add their name appended by a nonce, encrypted with a shared key. This way they can detect if Trudy adds her own lock as it will not have the appropriate tag. This method is equivalent to cryptographically signing the padlocks.
