\subsection{Decrypted text}

I came to security from cryptography and thought of the problem in a military like fashion most writings about security come from this perspective and it can be summed up pretty easily security threats are to be avoided using preventive counter measures this is how encryption works the threat is eavesdropping and encryption provides the prophylactic this could all be explained with block diagrams alice is communicating with bob both are identified by boxes and there is a line between them signifying the communication eve is the eavesdropper she also is a box and has a dotted line attached to the communications lines he is able to intercept the communication the only way to prevent eve from learning what alice and bob are talking about is through a preventive counter measure encryption theres no detection theres no response theres no risk management you have to avoid the threat for decades we have used this approach to computer security we draw boxes around the different players and lines between them we define different attackers eavesdroppers impersonators thieves and their capabilities we use preventive countermeasures like encryption and access control to avoid different threats if we can avoid the threats weve won if we cant weve lost imagine my surprise when i learned that the world doesnt work this way.
