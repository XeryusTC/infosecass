\item If we CRC 10101011 with 10011 the result is 1010, so we are looking for two values that also give 1010. We can do this if the result of the division is 110. 

If we start from the bottom and work towards a new number, we get the number 010110011010. This number would create a hash collision if we were to send this. We also get a hash collision if we send 001100011010. 

\item Trudy wants to send 111..... and she wants to this by colliding it with 11010110 and a divisor of 10011. The CRC checksum of 11010110 with 10011 as divisor is 0110 as can be seen from the following calculation:

110101100000\\
\underline{10011}\\
\phantom{1}10011\\
\phantom{1}\underline{10011}\\
\phantom{111111}10000\\
\phantom{111111}\underline{10011}\\
\phantom{11111111}0110\\

So the number that is sent is 110101100110. So we get a collision if we find a number that has 0000 as result. We can find such a number.
