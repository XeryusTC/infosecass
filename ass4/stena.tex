The hint "there is more to the slides than meets the eye" indicates that something should be hidden in the slides. A quick inspection of the slides reveals that there is some text behind the image on the first slide. This text reads: "The message is found by reading the third letter of each word". This means that the hidden message is: "secret writing".
