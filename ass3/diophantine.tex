Since spiders have 8 legs and beetles have 6 legs this problem can be expressed as $8x + 6y = 80$. Immediately an obvious answer becomes clear: $x=10, y=0$. Since the greatest common divisor of 6 and 8 is 2 and 80 is a multiple of this we can solve this problem using linear Diophantine equations. We can rewrite the equation to $4x + 3y = 40$, and since 3 and 4 are relatively prime
