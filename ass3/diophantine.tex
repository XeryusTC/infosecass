Since spiders have 8 legs and beetles have 6 legs this problem can be expressed as $8x + 6y = 80$. Immediately an obvious answer becomes clear: $x=10, y=0$. Since the greatest common divisor of 6 and 8 is 2 and 80 is a multiple of this we can solve this problem using linear Diophantine equations.

When we divide the equation by two we get $4x + 3y = 40$, further rewriting gives us $x = -\frac{3}{4}y + 10$. This means that $y$ needs to increase in steps of 4, using the same reasoning we can find that $x$ needs to increase in steps of 3. Using $x=10, y=0$ as starting point we then find the additional solutions of $x=7, y=4; x=4, y=8; x=1, y=12$. No other solutions are possible as that would mean that there are negative spiders or beetles in the box. We can also write the solutions in the more generic form of $x = 10 - 3n$ and $y = 4n$ where $n = 0, 1, 2, 3$.
